A Guide to Southern Gardening by Jim Notestein<br>
<br>
<small style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><b>What do we mean by "southern gardening"</b></small><small><b>?<br>
<br>
</b></small> <small>We
mean the region known to gardeners as the Coastal South, stretching
from the Gulf coast of Texas to the Atlantic coast of South Carolina.
The region as a whole shares a number of distinctive characteristics:
long, hot, humid summers; mild winters; abundant rain and sunshine
(usually); many native plants; and best of all, the opportunity for
year-round gardening. <br>
</small> <br>
<small>We
focus on North Central Florida because
that's where we are, and because it makes a good microcosm of the
region as a whole. <br>
<br>
</small> <small style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"> <b>Why do southern gardeners
need a special
website?</b></small><br>
<br><small>
Because
gardening here is different. We're in the transition zone
between temperate and tropical climates. Advice you get from gardening
books and instructions on seed packets may give great results in Ohio,
but produce only weeds and frustration here. A plant that needs full
summer sun in Michigan may look like it's been toasted if it gets full
summer sun in Florida. Our mild winters don't kill off bugs and weeds
the way northern winters do, and so soil preparation and planting
techniques that work up north can yield a bumper crop of aggravation
here. In other words, we need a site that tells us how to grow where
we're planted. </small> <br>
