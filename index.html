A Guide to Southern Gardening by Jim Notestein</b>



<h5>What do we mean by &quot;Southern gardening"?</h5>

We

mean the region known to gardeners as the Coastal South, stretching

from the Gulf coast of Texas to the Atlantic coast of South Carolina.

The region as a whole shares a number of distinctive characteristics:

long, hot, humid summers; mild winters; abundant rain and sunshine

(usually); many native plants; and best of all, the opportunity for

year-round gardening. <br>

 <br>

We

focus on North Central Florida because

that's where we are, and because it makes a good microcosm of the

region as a whole.



 <h5>Why do Southern gardeners

need a special

website?</h5>



Because

gardening here is different. We're in the transition zone

between temperate and tropical climates. Advice you get from gardening

books and instructions on seed packets may give great results in Ohio,

but produce only weeds and frustration here. A plant that needs full

summer sun in Michigan may look like it's been toasted if it gets full

summer sun in Florida. Our mild winters don't kill off bugs and weeds

the way northern winters do, and so soil preparation and planting

techniques that work up north can yield a bumper crop of aggravation

here. In other words, we need a site that tells us how to grow where

we're planted.

<h5>How do we know all this?</h5>
