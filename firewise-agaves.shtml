<h3>Protect Your Family and Home from Wildfires...<br>
with &quot;Always-on-Guard&quot; Firewise Agaves</h3>

<p><b><img border="0" src="http://southerngardening.org/images/firewise%20agaves.jpg" width="325" height="179" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5">If a wildfire threatens your home or neighborhood – call 911.</b> Devastating wildfires are becoming more common. Exterior surfaces of existing buildings can be retrofitted to resist fire hazards. A landscape makeover would most likely be far less expensive.</p>

<p><b>Install Agaves (aka Century Plants) and other succulents (Aloes, Sedums, etc.) as the principle plant material within the 30 foot fire perimeter of your
home.</b> Fire retardant Agaves will push back against wildfire that might threaten your home. In a wildfire event, while you wait for mobile first responders – your firewise Agaves & other succulents are your residential “first responders”. The aggressive front line of a wild fire is opportunistic, but it requires burnable plants. Deny a wild fire the plant fuel it needs – the fire will retreat.</p>

<p><b>Your firewise landscape can include decorative rocks, gravel mulches, & other non-combustible elements in the 30 foot zone of highest fire risk.</b> Southern Gardening offers
<a href="http://southerngardening.org/agaves-for-landscape.shtml"><b> many choices of
Firewise Agaves</b></a>, from two-inch high groundcover Agaves to monumental specimens that can spread to 30 feet diameter. Southern Gardening offers four Agave species with soft & yielding leaf tips & no teeth on the leaf edges (Huggable Agaves).</p>

<p><b>Your decision to become firewise should be mentioned to your fire insurance agent.</b> Less fire risk deserves a premium discount. Spread the word…make things better. Firewise Agaves: visually striking, drought tolerant and low maintenance. Firewise Agaves: less risk, good for you!</p>

<p><b><i>For more firewise guidance: contact your county forestry agency, your county co-operative extensions service, or local landscape designers.<br>
