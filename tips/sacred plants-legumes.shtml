<h3>Sacred and Useful Plants: Legumes</h3>

    <p><img border="0" src="/tips/images/legumes.jpg" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right">The family of legumes is huge. There are string and shell beans from America; scarlet runners and limas from Central America; cowpea or black-eyed peas and asparagus beans or yard-long beans from Arabia, Antilles, the Americas, Africa, and the far East; peas from India and China; chick-peas or garbanzos from India; lentils from Egypt and India; and lupines and broad beans or faba beans from the Mediterranean basin.</p>
	 <p>In ancient days, beans were used in collecting votes from the people --  white for approval – dark for disapproval. Magistrates were elected by the casting of beans.</p>
	 <p>Beans and lentils are mentioned in Ezekiel 4: 9. Lentils are also mentioned in Genesis 25:29-34, Samuel 23:11, and 2 Samuel 17:28.</p>
	 <p>Faba vulgaris or broad bean is annual, indigenous to northern Persia (Iraq) and was extensively cultivated throughout western Asia in the Neo-lithic (5,000 BC); found in Egyptian mummy coffins; familiar to the Greeks and Romans – who introduced them to England – where they were used as animal fodder and were known as Windsor beans. Still widely grown in Palestine and Syria, broad bean is boiled and eaten as a vegetable. Faba bean meal may be added to wheat bread for nutritional boost and flavor. (Contact the author for recipe)</p>
	 <p>Faba plants are hardy, erect, sometimes hollow simple stemmed and grow to 3’ tall with compound leaves and white pea-like flowers. Pods are thick. The shores of the Nile are often beautifully fragrant with the bloom perfume. Faba is currently distributed world-wide as a garden plant. It has thus far no where been found in a wild state and it is quite possible that the wild ancestor has with time become extinct. It is drought resistant and a green manure crop for winter.</p>
 <p>Sown in early October, faba blooms in February, and is harvested in May.</p>
	 <p>Faba seed is available on-line, from catalogs, and whole-food stores. To plant, soak overnight, cover with soil @ 3x thickness of seed (a general rule.)  Place seeds on 6” centers in a thick bed with corner stakes and a rope corral or light fencing to control flopping.</p>
	 <p>Dry faba beans have a higher nutritive value than fresh: 87% solids, 21% protein, 53% carbohydrates, 3% lipids, 3% ash, and the highest calorific content among legumes -- after chick peas: 332 calories per 100 grams.</p>
	 <p>The author began faba field trials in 2009 in his home garden to develop a cultivar for North Central Florida and explore natural genetic variability. He invites your questions and suggestions: Call Jim Notestein at 352-372- 2107.    </p>
