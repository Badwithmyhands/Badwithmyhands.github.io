<h3>Our Sacred Garden</h3>

    <p><img border="0" src="/tips/images/sacred.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5">My wife and I have been growing plants of many kinds for over 40 years in North Central Florida.

<p>Our soils and climate allow the Alachua County region to display a wonderful range of plants from around the world. Our region also draws citizens from many lands.

<p>Of course, the vital and delightful array of native plants only adds to our horticultural opportunities.

<p>Recently, it came to our attention that many plants associated with the Mediterranean basin can grow well here – while remaining well-behaved and even useful.

<p>Upon reflection, it seems that we have begun our own Sacred Garden. We plan to celebrate this idea in many ways.

<p>We have assembled a reference library on the subject and are expanding our demonstration gardens.

<p>We have identified over 100 plant species that are specifically mentioned in sacred texts or are generally referred to as “flowers” with a nativity or heritage to the Mediterranean basin. (Wikipedia search term: bible plants)

<p>We invite you to visit us. We can help you begin your own Sacred Garden. Grow with us.
