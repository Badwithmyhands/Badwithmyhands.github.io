<h3>A Garden Glossary</h3>

    <p><i><img border="0" src="/tips/images/garden%20glossary.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5">This glossary will provide gardening enthusiasts a foundation for the vocabulary of horticultural terms useful to more fully enjoy the plant kingdom and gardening arts. Other texts will have a more complete glossary for less frequently used terms.</i></p>

<p><b>Acid</b>. Having an excess of free hydrogen ions. Acid solutions taste "sour" and turn litmus paper red. See pH and Alkaline.</p>

<p><b>Adventitious</b>. Arising by chance, or unpredictably, out of the usual place.</p>

<p><b>Air-layering</b>. A method of vegetative propagation in which a damp rooting medium is placed around a section of plant stem from which the bark has been removed. The clump of rooting medium is wrapped and sealed under a layer of aluminum foil or plastic film. After several weeks, roots will form and the new plant can be cut from the mother and planted after the wrapping is removed. The term, Marcottage, is sometimes used with the same meaning. (see Ground-layering)</p>

<p><b>Alkaline</b>. Having an excess of free hydroxyl ions, and so a deficiency of free hydrogen ions. Lacking any sour taste, alkaline or basic soils are often called "sweet." See pH and Acid.</p>

<p><b>Alternate</b>. Any arrangement of leaves not opposite or whorled; placed singly at different heights on the stem.</p>

<p><b>Annual</b>. A plant whose life cycle is a single growing season.</p>

<p><b>Anther</b>. The enlarged tip of the stamen in which pollen is developed.</p>


<p><b>B & B</b>. Balled and burlapped. One method of compactly holding plant roots and soil while transporting between growing sites.</p>

<p><b>Basic</b>. See Alkaline.</p>

<p><b>Berry</b>. Pulpy fruit that does not split open.</p>

<p><b>Biennial</b>. A plant that completes its life cycle in two years and then dies; normally flowering the second year.</p>

<p><b>Blade</b>. The expanded or flattened part of the leaf.</p>

<p><b>Bloom</b>. The thin waxy coating, easily rubbed off, on some fruits and on some palm foliage. See Cuticle.</p>

<p><b>Cambium</b>. The outermost ring of cells around the sapwood of a plant stem or tree trunk. This remarkable sheath of cells is only one cell thick and extends from the roots to the topmost twig. This dividing layer of cells builds new conducting tissues: the wood or xylem, which conducts water and minerals upward from the roots, and the phloem, which transports food manufactured from the leaves. In its annual growth, the cambium is responsible for the increase in trunk and stem girth.</p>

<p><b>Chlorosis</b> (klor-o-sis). Loss of the green color from leaves, leaving them yellowish-green. It may be due to lack of needed nutrient elements, to inability to absorb those elements because of excess water or root disease, or to the direct action of insects or fungi on the leaves.</p>

<p><b>Clay</b>. Mineral matter of exceedingly fine particle size in the soil,often holding water tenaciously.</p>

<p><b>Clone</b>. A group of plants, increased vegetatively, from a single bud; a horticultural variety. Vegetatively produced progeny of a single plant.</p>
