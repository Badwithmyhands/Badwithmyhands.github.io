        Help! You have ugly brown spots on your tomatoes, the leaves just fell 
        off your azaleas, and the dead spot in your lawn is spreading! Help!<br> 
        <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> Well, you 
        might ask your neighbor for advice or the weekend assistant at the garden 
        center might have a clue.<br> <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> 
        But if you want accurate information from someone with more knowledge 
        and more experience, call a Cooperative Extension Agent. It's their job 
        to answer all your horticultural and agricultural questions. Their office 
        is a gold mine of useful, easy to understand information on most every 
        subject involving the plant kingdom. Some agents even make house calls.<br>

<p> Extension agents are part of a nation-wide system &#8212; the Cooperative 
          Extension Service (CES). CES is an information network linking the <a
href="http://www.usda.gov/">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>, land-grant universities, 
          county governments, and individual extension agents.<br>
          <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> In 1914, 
          the Smith-Lever Act founded the CES and its principal mission was to 
          sustain and expand U.S. agriculture. As our country has become more 
          urban, CES began reaching out to town and city dwellers.<br>
          <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> Today's 
          extension agents help anyone who has questions on a wide range of subjects, 
          including consumer affairs, community development, food and water quality, 
          home and family, and, of course, growing plants.<br>
          <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> CES is funded 
          by taxes &#8212; federal, state, and local. For this reason, most of 
          its services are free or require only a modest fee. Advice is always 
          free, even if it involves consultation from scientists and experts at 
          the university. Most CES publications are free and CES provides programs 
          for homeowners' associations, garden clubs, schools, and environmental 
          groups &#8212; usually at no cost.<br>

        <h2><a name="local">The local Extension Office</a></h2>
        <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> In Florida, 
        the Cooperative Extension Service is administered by the <a href="http://www.ifas.ufl.edu/">Institute 
        of Food and Agricultural Sciences</a> of the <a href="http://www.ufl.edu/">University 
        of Florida</a>. Most CES offices are staffed by several agents, support 
        personnel, and volunteer assistants. Generally, there is a CES office 
        in each county.<br> 
        <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> For gardeners, 
        the range of CES services is broad. You can call or visit the office and 
        get individual attention for questions or problems. They will advise you 
        on <a href="soilqual.htm">how to get your soil tested</a> by the nearest 
        state laboratory. This test is very important to keep your plants happy 
        and productive. It costs about $3 for a simple test and $7 for a more 
        complete test.<br> <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> 
        Most CES offices conduct courses and workshops. The office also offers 
        information sheets, pamphlets, and books &#8212; written by horticulturists 
        and researchers on almost any garden topic you can think of. CES now has 
        a <a href="http://www.ifas.ufl.edu/www/agator/htm/ces.htm">website</a> 
        that will allow you to browse or download most of their printed information.<br> 
        <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> For the convenience 
        of local residents, here are maps you can view or print, showing the location 
        of

        <p><a name="agent">The Extension Agen</a>t</p>
        <p> CES agents are university-trained professionals &#8212; dedicated 
          to sharing scientific information on every aspect of agriculture and 
          horticulture. Although they have a field of specialty, they all receive 
          in-depth training in many subjects to prepare them for a diverse clientele. 
          When a question is over their head, they can tap resources of the state 
          university system and other CES offices across the nation.<br>
          <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> In rural 
          areas, CES may focus on the needs of farmers, their families, and their 
          communities. In more metropolitan areas, CES also responds to small 
          gardeners, city planners, school personnel, transportation engineers, 
          park superintendents, and others with horticultural questions.<br>
          <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> Funding 
          can affect the availability and depth of CES on a county-by-county basis. 
          Gardeners tend to be less vocal than farmers. When government at any 
          level makes cuts in programs, CES in general (and horticulture especially!) 
          tends to feel the pinch first and hardest.<br>

        <h2><a name="master">The 
          Master Gardener program</a></h2>
        <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> In response 
        to growing numbers of gardening inquiries from homeowners, a unique organization 
        of auxiliary experts, the Master Gardeners, has joined forces with cooperative 
        extension. Master Gardeners are volunteers who must pass intensive short 
        courses in horticulture. In return for their certification, they provide 
        50 hours of horticulture-related service to their community.<br> <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> 
        This Master Gardener network now has over 40,000 members in the U.S. and 
        Canada. You can put yourself on the other side of the CES counter if you 
        like gardening, like helping people, and are willing to take the intensive 
        training. Contact your CES for details.<br> <h2><a name="contact">Contacting

        <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt=""> Your CES is 
        a resource just waiting to be tapped. Call or stop by. The agent will 
        know what's best to do about those tomato spots, the curled-up leaves,

        help with.<br> <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt="">
