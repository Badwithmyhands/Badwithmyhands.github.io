    <img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt="">
    We love to hear from you!  We always want to know what you
like (and don't like) about our site, what you'd like to
see us add, and when you agree or disagree with our advice.  
Lettuce know what you think.
   <br><img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="16" alt="">
And, yes, we want you to write us with specific gardening questions; it
really does help us stay focused on what our audience is interested in.

    <p><img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt="">
<b>For <u>your</u> benefit</b> 
there are a few things we ask.  We call
them our "frequently given answers."  We're not trying to squash your
questions &#8212; it's just that a lot of times, people can get better and
faster answers by helping themselves.
</p><ul>
<b>#1. Have you checked the yellow pages of your phone book?</b>
   <br><img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="16" alt="">
   We <u>cannot</u> tell you who sells what or offers what services in your area
   (except for our advertisers, of course).  Really.  Don't even.
<p>
<b>#2. Have you asked your county extension agent?</b>
   <br><img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="16" alt="">
   If you have <u>any</u> question about <b>lawns</b>, <b>trees</b> or <b>vegetables</b>, your county
   extension agent can probably answer it immediately over the phone.
   You'll probably be pleasantly surprised at how knowledgeable and
   helpful they are (if you don't call them at 1am).  REMEMBER: they're
   the experts on your local situation, and the reason they're there is
   to answer <u>your</u> questions.  That's what you pay them for.
</p><p>
<b>#3. Have you tried our <a href="tips/index.htm">tips</a> and <a href="links/index.htm">links</a> pages?</b>
   <br><img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="16" alt="">
   Unless we know the answer from our own experience, 
   we turn to the Web for help.  First, we look for <a href="links/pubs.htm">extension publications</a>.
   (We try the <a href="tips/uf_docs.htm">Florida extension publications</a> first, 
   because they're the most, um, extensive.)
   Next, we refer to the <a href="links/ref.htm">references</a> page.
</p><p>
<b>#4. Where are you?</b>
   <br><img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="16" alt="">
   Contrary to popular belief, we cannot tell where you are from your e-mail return address.
   If you don't tell us where you are, we won't know.
   <br><img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="16" alt="">
   This is especially important if you're asking us a gardening question; in fact, 
   it's a <b>requirement</b> for us to be able to give you a good answer.
   And even if you're not asking a gardening question, we'd really like to
   know where you are, just so we'll know where our audience is.
</p></ul>

    <p><img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt="">
    And <b>for <u>our</u> benefit</b>, there's one other thing we ask:
</p><ul>
<p>
<b>Please turn off HTML encoding.</b>
   <br><img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="16" alt="">
   If your e-mail program generates its message in both plain text format
   and HTML format at the same time, please turn off the HTML format.  We would
   suggest that you leave it off, except when you're sending e-mail to someone
   who actually wants you to write in different colors, sizes and fonts.
   <br><img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="16" alt="">
   The problem with e-mail in HTML format is that it nearly triples the
   file size of mail in our in-box, and our e-mail programs don't understand
   HTML anyway.
</p></ul>


    <p><img src="images/dot_clr.gif" width="15" height="1" alt="">
<b>Having said all that . . . </b>
if you have a plant question, the more you can tell us
about the plant's history and growing conditions, the
better we can help. And, one more time, <b>please tell
us where you are</b>.
