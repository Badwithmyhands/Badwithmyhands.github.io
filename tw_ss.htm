    <p>   
    As you begin to dig into the new year's garden, could you (and your garden) use a little
<b>hands-on expert help</b>?  Definitely maybe? Then this would be a good time to 
contact <a href="dbn/index.htm">Designs by Notestein</a>.

    </p><p>   
    Or maybe you're the do-it-yourself type. In that case, this would be an excellent time to pay a
visit to <a href="goerings/index.htm">Goerings Book Store</a> for any of the 
<a href="revs/index.htm">books we recommend</a>.

    </p><p>   
    Now, we know you could order those same books from one of those gigantic online booksellers
everybody's talking about.  But (as we'll explain), we hope you don't.

    </p><p>   
    We could even set up links so you could order them through <b>SouthernGardening</b>,
and we could collect a royalty on each one.  But we don't.

    </p><p>   
    So, why should we buy our books from a local bookstore rather than online?
The answer is a lot like why we should grow <b>native plants</b>:  There's only so much available
habitat (market).  The more of that habitat (market) we cultivate in fast-growing exotics,
the less room there is for natives, and gradually the natives will decline and vanish.

    </p><p>   
    A local bookstore has several <b>advantages</b>, especially for gardeners, that simply can't be provided online:
</p><ul>
<li>You can browse the books until you find the one that's just right for your current needs;
    you don't have to rely on guesswork or someone else's recommendation.
</li><li>After all, bookstores are just fun places to go, period.
</li><li>You can buy the book and begin using it immediately, not several days from now.
    And there's no cardboard, bubble-wrap or styrofoam peanuts to dispose of.
</li><li>They host book signings for authors, giving you a chance to meet and talk with the experts.
</li><li>You can build a personal relationship with the sales staff, so they can tailor their business to fit your interests.
</li><li>Finally, they're part of your community, paying taxes and supporting other businesses and organizations in ways 
    that contribute directly to your quality of life.
</li></ul>

    <p>   
    What advantage does an online bookseller have?  Price?  Convenience? Okay, <b>let's do the math</b> &#8212; suppose you want a book
that lists for $35.  At a 30% discount, the online sale price would be $24.50.  But now there's the shipping
charge. (Oh, and if the book isn't in their warehouse, add an extra week or so to the delivery times.)

    </p><p>   
    Four dollars for shipping will get the book to you in 3 - 7 business days.  <i>IF</i> the book contains
what you wanted, and <i>IF</i> you can stand to wait that long (or longer), you've saved $6.50, about 20% of
the original price.

    </p><p>   
    But what if you don't want to wait that long?  The shipping charge for second day air will be $8, bringing
the total to $32.50 and saving only $2.50 or about 7% off.  And next-day air? That'll cost $11, for a total
of $35.50, or fifty cents <i>more</i> than the original list price.  

    </p><p>   
    Of course, if the book you want lists for $25 or less, the "savings" are even less impressive.

    </p><p>   
    Is it worth it?  Reminds us of the old <b>Ral Donner</b> song, "You Don't Know What You've Got (Until You Lose It)."
